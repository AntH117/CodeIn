## Overview
This is my first full-stack project, designed to showcase the front-end projects Iâ€™ve built, while also demonstrating my ability to integrate a Node.js/Express backend with a MongoDB database, implement authentication with Firebase, and deploy a fully responsive application. This platform allows users to:
* Upload and showcase projects with detailed descriptions, including support for images, GIFs, and code snippets through a built-in code editor, with the option to add tags.
* Create an account using Firebase Authentication to engage with the community by liking and commenting on projects shared by other users.
* Responsive design that works seamlessly across devices.
